## Howdy,

I'm a full stack developer living in the Greater Denver Area, currently on the hunt for a Junior role.
My go to technologies are ***Next.js*** / ***React*** with ***TypeScript***, although I am currently having a great time immersing myself in the world of ***iOS*** with ***Swift*** and ***Ruby***.

### üõ†Ô∏è I'm Currently Building...
...an outdoor sports / activity tracking application with ***iOS / SwiftUI***, ***Mapbox***, ***Ruby / Rails***, ***PostgreSQL***, and ***AWS***.

If you are familiar with the application Strava, It's basically my own personal version of that.

#### Some highlights so far:
- Working with iOS location data.
- Finding the similarities and differences between SwiftUI and React.
- Ruby on Rails is intuitive and satisfying.

### üèîÔ∏è Some More About Me
- Big fan of working / collaborating with others especially when great communication is a shared goal.
- Been a musician / guitarist for over two decades. Love playing Bluegrass, Funk, and Jazz.
- Love outdoor stuff, particularly Skiing and Mountain Biking.
- Life, in a way, is about finding balance between novel and familiar experiences. (I just thought of that, lmk if it's any good.)
